# Copy Kitten

### Quick Summary

Use html and css to copy the three components, screenshots of which, in their various states, are in their respective sub-directories.

### Stretch Goals

##### Button

* Add some styling to the button for when it's clicked using a [fill in the blank here] pseudoselector. Look up "inset shadow" for a neat effect!
* Capitalize only the first letter of each word in the button. With CSS!


##### Header

* Now that you've worked to make it look good horizontally, make the header vertical again. Be sure to move the "nav ribbon" (the grey part) as well. And you may have to remove the bullet points to make it pretty!


##### Table

* Add a background color to each cell when you hover over it. What part of the whole thing gets that color?
* Try adding some space between each `<a>` of a row. What does this do to the "clickable" space?
